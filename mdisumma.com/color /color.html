    <p>You make color choices all the time, even if you dont realize it.It usually happens by instinct, but there is actually an entire science behind it called Color Theory. Color Theory describe how different color relate to each other, and how they look when they are combined into many colored schemes. an offshot of color theory is color psychology, wich explores colors and emotions.</p>

</div>

    <p>The Color Wheel is an illustrative diagram that shows 12 colors around the circle, used to represent each coulor's relationship to onether. Colours arranged opposite to each other are complementary to another. Colors located near other colors share common caracteristics and often pair well together.</p>

      <dl>Hue</dl>
      <dd>Hue refers to the pure, saturated colors seen on the color wheel.</dd>
      <dl>Tints</dl>
      <dd>Tints are achieved by incorporating elements of white to brighten and desaturate a single hue. Thints of a color are often much calmer than their saturated counterparts</dd>
      <dl>Tones</dl>
      <dd>Tones are achieved by adding grey to a hue, dulling the overall chroma.</dd>
      <dl>Shades</dl>
      <dd>Shades are achieved by adding portions of black to a single hue, creating a darker hue.</dd>
      <dl>Saturation</dl>
      <dd>Saturation refers to the overall intensity, of chroma, in a color. A pure hue is more saturated than its tint or tone.</dd>
      <dl>Value</dl>
      <dd>Value refers to the general lightness or darkness of a color. A lighter hue has more value than a darker hue.</dd>

      <h4>Primary colors</h4>
        <p>Primari colors are the "original" color, consisting of red, yellow, and blue. You can't mix any colors together to get these colors.</p>
        <p>This powerful triad shapes the fundation of color theory as we know it. these three pigments are the building block of an extensive color range, or gamut. When combined, they create secondary and tertiary colors along with all hues in between.</p>

      <h4>Secondary colors</h4>
      <p>Secondary colors are formed from an equal mixture of two separate primary colors. Yellow and blue mix to create green, yellow and red mix to create orange, and blue and red mix to create violet.</p>
      <p>On the color wheel, secondary colors lie in the middle of and equidistant from the two primary colors used to create it. The secondaries are grouped in a triad that creates an inverted equilateral triangle.</p>

      <h4>Tertiary colors</h4>
      <p>Tertiaty colors are created by combining adjacent primary and secondary hues. For example, a primary color, such as yellow, and a secondary color, such as green, mix to create yellow-green.</p>
      <p>The name of each tertiary colors begins with the neighbouring primary color combined with the neighbourin secondary color, such as yellow-green.</p>

<div class="text">
      <h4>Complementary</h4>
      <p>Two colors that are on opposite sides of the color wheel. This combination provides a high contrast and high impact color combination – together, these colors will appear brighter and more prominent.</p>

      <h4>Monocromatic</h4>
      <p>Three shades, tones and tints of one base color. Provides a subtle and conservative color combination. This is a versatile color combination that is easy to apply to design projects for a harmonious look.</p>

      <h4>Analogous</h4>
      <p>Three colors that are side by side on the color wheel. This color combination is versatile, but can be overwhelming. To balance an analogous color scheme, choose one dominant color, and use the others as accents.</p>

      <h4>Triadic</h4>
      <p>Three colors that are evenly spaced on the color wheel. This provides a high contrast color scheme, but less so than the complementary color combination — making it more versatile. This combination creates bold, vibrant color palettes.</p>

      <h4>Tetradic</h4>
      <p>Four colors that are evenly spaced on the color wheel. Tetradic color schemes are bold and work best if you let one color be dominant, and use the others as accents. The more colors you have in your palette, the more difficult it is to balance,</p>

      <p>The color wheel can also be divided into warm and cool colors. The warmth or coolness of a color is also known as its color temperature. The color combinations found on a color wheel often have a balance of warm and cool colors. According to color psychology, different color temperatures evoke different feelings. For example, warm colors are said to bring to mind coziness and energy, while cool colors are associated with serenity and isolation.</p>
      <p>Warm colors are the colors from red through to yellow. These colors are said to bring to mind warmth, like the sun.</p>
      <p>Cool colors are the colors from blue to green and purple. These colors are said to bring to mind coolness, like water.</p>
